# Aliana Pilao (Ali)
Welcome to OPIM 3223!

## Lemmi tell you more about me 

### Introductions!
Hi! My name is Aliana Pilao but feel free to call me Ali from now on. I am a Senior MIS Major with a Digital Marketing & Analystics and Communications Minor here at the University of Connecticut. 

I have a pretty jam packed schedule this semester so let me take you through my day. 

### Mornings with Me 
I am not a morning person so my earliest class starts at 11AM on Tuesday/Thursdays and 12:30PM on Monday/Wednesdays. I like to have a relaxing morning or else I will be cranky throughout the day
