# Aliana Pilao (Ali)
Hi class! 

## Lemmi tell you more about me 

### Introductions!
Heyoo! My name is Aliana Pilao but feel free to call me Ali from now on. I am a Senior MIS Major with a Digital Marketing & Analystics and Communications Minor here at the University of Connecticut. 

I have a pretty jam packed schedule this semester so let me take you through my day. 

### Mornings with Me 
I am not a morning person so my earliest class starts at 11AM on Tuesday/Thursdays and 12:30PM on Monday/Wednesdays. I like to have a relaxing morning or else I will be cranky throughout the day. 


Usually I like to wake up 2 hours before my classes and cook myself a beefy breakfast- toast and omelettes. 

### Afternoons with Me 
- Class Class Class and MORE CLASS ! (Taking 18 credits this semester, fun !)
- I Work at UCTV as Communications Director so that also takes up a lot of my afternoons 
- Catch me at the SU Dunkin tables during my breaks if I am not in class or working 

### Nights with Me 
- Exec Board and Communications Meetings !
- And finally, I like to finish my days off at the Gym  
- Oh and eat din din of course.
